The Contiki-NG operating system processes source routing headers (SRH) in its two alternative RPL protocol implementations. The IPv6 implementation uses the results of this processing to determine whether an incoming packet should be forwarded to another host. Because of missing validation of the resulting next-hop address, an uncontrolled recursion may occur in the tcpip_ipv6_output function in the os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c module when receiving a packet with a next-hop address that is a local address. Attackers that have the possibility to send IPv6 packets to the Contiki-NG host can therefore trigger deeply nested recursive calls, which can cause a stack overflow. The vulnerability has not been patched in the current release of Contiki-NG, but is expected to be patched in the next release. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2264. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release.

We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's\nchecked most frequently during backtracking.\n\nThis change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of\nprecision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known\ndeficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of\nverified states, explored in the subsequent patches.\n\nThere are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files\naccording to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).\n\nFile                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)\n--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------\ntest_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)\n\nNote, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to\nminimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between\nbpf and bpf-next trees.\n\nNotice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of\ninstruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of\nrelying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we\nalready have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we\nadded jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but\nalso we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we\ndon't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is\npresent.\n\nRelying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one\nthat was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.\n\n  [0] https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20231110002638.4168352-3-andrii@kernel.org/",

      "cveDis": "btcd is an alternative full node bitcoin implementation written in Go (golang). The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core's \"FindAndDelete()\" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a \"standard\" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = \"<data> <data||foo>\"` and `dataToRemove = \"data\"` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push. This has been patched in btcd version v0.24.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

The vulnerability arises due to the use of the `eval()` function to parse a string received from a remote AWS SageMaker LLM endpoint into a dictionary. This method of parsing is unsafe as it can execute arbitrary Python code contained within the response. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the response from the AWS SageMaker LLM endpoint to include malicious Python code, leading to potential execution of arbitrary commands on the system hosting the application. The issue is fixed in version 0.6.0.",

This causes page cache operations to\nhang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,\ntruncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when\nan inode is evicted from memory, will hang.\n\nSecond, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared. \nAs a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that's\nfine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with\nNILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the \"sc_dirty_files\"\nlist, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,\ncorrupting the block mapping.\n\nFix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()\non failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),\nhaving it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and\ncorrecting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure\nthat the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared.",

If physical blocks are not submitted in\nthe incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency\nissues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()\nand BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.\n\nSecond, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for\nefficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement\neasily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear in\nfuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages\nfor correctness.\n\nAdditionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot be\ntruncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 (\"erofs: tidy\nup `struct z_erofs_bvec`\") for simplicity although it shouldn't be any\ndifference.",

Also, sharing\nthe cached state is not a good idea since it could result in incorrect\nresults in the future - right now it should not be a problem because it\nend ups being used only in extent-io-tree.c:count_range_bits() where we do\nrange validation before using the cached state.\n\nFix this by protecting the private assignment and check of a file while\nholding the inode's spinlock and keep track of the task that allocated\nthe private, so that it's used only by that task in order to prevent\nuser-after-free issues with the cached state record as well as potentially\nusing it incorrectly in the future.",

      "cveDis": "Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime's implementation of WebAssembly tail calls combined with stack traces can result in a runtime crash in certain WebAssembly modules. The runtime crash may be undefined behavior if Wasmtime was compiled with Rust 1.80 or prior. The runtime crash is a deterministic process abort when Wasmtime is compiled with Rust 1.81 and later. WebAssembly tail calls are a proposal which relatively recently reached stage 4 in the standardization process. Wasmtime first enabled support for tail calls by default in Wasmtime 21.0.0, although that release contained a bug where it was only on-by-default for some configurations. In Wasmtime 22.0.0 tail calls were enabled by default for all configurations. The specific crash happens when an exported function in a WebAssembly module (or component) performs a `return_call` (or `return_call_indirect` or `return_call_ref`) to an imported host function which captures a stack trace (for example, the host function raises a trap). In this situation, the stack-walking code previously assumed there was always at least one WebAssembly frame on the stack but with tail calls that is no longer true. With the tail-call proposal it's possible to have an entry trampoline appear as if it directly called the exit trampoline. This situation triggers an internal assert in the stack-walking code which raises a Rust `panic!()`. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.80 and prior this means that an `extern \"C\"` function in Rust is raising a `panic!()`. This is technically undefined behavior and typically manifests as a process abort when the unwinder fails to unwind Cranelift-generated frames. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.81 and later this panic becomes a deterministic process abort. Overall the impact of this issue is that this is a denial-of-service vector where a malicious WebAssembly module or component can cause the host to crash. There is no other impact at this time other than availability of a service as the result of the crash is always a crash and no more. This issue was discovered by routine fuzzing performed by the Wasmtime project via Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure. We have no evidence that it has ever been exploited by an attacker in the wild. All versions of Wasmtime which have tail calls enabled by default have been patched: * 21.0.x - patched in 21.0.2 * 22.0.x - patched in 22.0.1 * 23.0.x - patched in 23.0.3  * 24.0.x - patched in 24.0.1 * 25.0.x - patched in 25.0.2. Wasmtime versions from 12.0.x (the first release with experimental tail call support) to 20.0.x (the last release with tail-calls off-by-default) have support for tail calls but the support is disabled by default. These versions are not affected in their default configurations, but users who explicitly enabled tail call support will need to either disable tail call support or upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime. The main workaround for this issue is to disable tail support for tail calls in Wasmtime, for example with `Config::wasm_tail_call(false)`. Users are otherwise encouraged to upgrade to patched versions.",

      "cveDis": "Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly. Under certain concurrent event orderings, a `wasmtime::Engine`'s internal type registry was susceptible to double-unregistration bugs due to a race condition, leading to panics and potentially type registry corruption. That registry corruption could, following an additional and particular sequence of concurrent events, lead to violations of WebAssembly's control-flow integrity (CFI) and type safety. Users that do not use `wasmtime::Engine` across multiple threads are not affected. Users that only create new modules across threads over time are additionally not affected. Reproducing this bug requires creating and dropping multiple type instances (such as `wasmtime::FuncType` or `wasmtime::ArrayType`) concurrently on multiple threads, where all types are associated with the same `wasmtime::Engine`. **Wasm guests cannot trigger this bug.** See the \"References\" section below for a list of Wasmtime types-related APIs that are affected. Wasmtime maintains an internal registry of types within a `wasmtime::Engine` and an engine is shareable across threads. Types can be created and referenced through creation of a `wasmtime::Module`, creation of `wasmtime::FuncType`, or a number of other APIs where the host creates a function (see \"References\" below). Each of these cases interacts with an engine to deduplicate type information and manage type indices that are used to implement type checks in WebAssembly's `call_indirect` function, for example. This bug is a race condition in this management where the internal type registry could be corrupted to trigger an assert or contain invalid state. Wasmtime's internal representation of a type has individual types (e.g. one-per-host-function) maintain a registration count of how many time it's been used. Types additionally have state within an engine behind a read-write lock such as lookup/deduplication information. The race here is a time-of-check versus time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug where one thread atomically decrements a type entry's registration count, observes zero registrations, and then acquires a lock in order to unregister that entry. However, between when this first thread observed the zero-registration count and when it acquires that lock, another thread could perform the following sequence of events: re-register another copy of the type, which deduplicates to that same entry, resurrecting it and incrementing its registration count; then drop the type and decrement its registration count; observe that the registration count is now zero; acquire the type registry lock; and finally unregister the type. Now, when the original thread finally acquires the lock and unregisters the entry, it is the second time this entry has been unregistered. This bug was originally introduced in Wasmtime 19's development of the WebAssembly GC proposal. This bug affects users who are not using the GC proposal, however, and affects Wasmtime in its default configuration even when the GC proposal is disabled. Wasmtime users using 19.0.0 and after are all affected by this issue. We have released the following Wasmtime versions, all of which have a fix for this bug: * 21.0.2 * 22.0.1 * 23.0.3 * 24.0.1 * 25.0.2. If your application creates and drops Wasmtime types on multiple threads concurrently, there are no known workarounds. Users are encouraged to upgrade to a patched release.",

This vulnerability is a **lack of integrity check** on the downloaded FRP client, which could potentially allow attackers to introduce malicious code. If an attacker gains access to the remote URL from which the FRP client is downloaded, they could modify the binary without detection, as the Gradio server does not verify the file's checksum or signature.  Any users utilizing the Gradio server's sharing mechanism that downloads the FRP client could be affected by this vulnerability, especially those relying on the executable binary for secure data tunneling. There is no direct workaround for this issue without upgrading.

This is a **data validation vulnerability** affecting several Gradio components, which allows arbitrary file leaks through the post-processing step. Attackers can exploit these components by crafting requests that bypass expected input constraints. This issue could lead to sensitive files being exposed to unauthorized users, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities, such as issue TOB-GRADIO-15. The components most at risk are those that return or handle file data. Vulnerable Components: 1. **String to FileData:** DownloadButton, Audio, ImageEditor, Video, Model3D, File, UploadButton. 2. **Complex data to FileData:** Chatbot, MultimodalTextbox. 3. **Direct file read in preprocess:** Code. 4. **Dictionary converted to FileData:** ParamViewer, Dataset. Exploit Scenarios: 1. A developer creates a Dropdown list that passes values to a DownloadButton. An attacker bypasses the allowed inputs, sends an arbitrary file path (like `/etc/passwd`), and downloads sensitive files. 2. An attacker crafts a malicious payload in a ParamViewer component, leaking sensitive files from a server through the arbitrary file leak. This issue has been resolved in `gradio>5.0`.

Versions prior to 1.1.0 contain a vulnerability that involves a lack of input validation within the RDS AI framework, specifically within the user input handling code in the main module (`main.py`). This leaves the framework open to injection attacks and potential memory tampering. Any user or external actor providing input to the system could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious commands, corrupt stored data, or affect API calls. This is particularly critical for users employing RDS AI in production environments where it interacts with sensitive systems, performs dynamic memory caching, or retrieves user-specific data for analysis. Impacted areas include developers using the RDS AI system as a backend for AI-driven applications and systems running RDS AI that may be exposed to untrusted environments or receive unverified user inputs. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.0 of the RDS AI framework. All user inputs are now sanitized and validated against a set of rules designed to mitigate malicious content. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 or higher and ensure all dependencies are updated to their latest versions. For users unable to upgrade to the patched version, a workaround can be implemented. The user implementing the workaround should implement custom validation checks for user inputs to filter out unsafe characters and patterns (e.g., SQL injection attempts, script injections) and limit or remove features that allow user input until the system can be patched.",

This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage.\n\nA server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `\"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox\"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor.

Upgrade to a version of the library where a fix is available.\n1. Review the steps in [this previous advisory](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) to ensure you have your application configured for untrusted data.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading MessagePack to a patched version is not an option for you, you may apply a manual workaround as follows:\n\n1. Declare a class that derives from `MessagePackSecurity`.\n2. Override the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>` method to provide a collision-resistant hash function of your own and avoid calling `base.GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>()`.\n3. Configure a `MessagePackSerializerOptions` with an instance of your derived type by calling `WithSecurity` on an existing options object.\n4. Use your custom options object for all deserialization operations. This may be by setting the `MessagePackSerializer.DefaultOptions` static property, if you call methods that rely on this default property, and/or by passing in the options object explicitly to any `Deserialize` method.\n\n### References\n\n- Learn more about best security practices when reading untrusted data with [MessagePack 1.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/tree/v1.x#security) or [MessagePack 2.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp#security).\n- The .NET team's [discussion on hash collision vulnerabilities of their `HashCode` struct](https://github.com/GrabYourPitchforks/runtime/blob/threat_models/docs/design/security/System.HashCode.md).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Start a public discussion](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/discussions)\n* [Email us privately](mailto:andrewarnott@live.com)",

Note that this does not allow reading new data that the user should not have had access to, only triggering a side effect a user should not have been able to trigger.\n\nTo be vulnerable, an affected user must have an update action that is on a resource with no attributes containing an \"update default\" (updated_at timestamp, for example); can be performed atomically; does not have `require_atomic? false`; has at least one authorizer (typically `Ash.Policy.Authorizer`); and has at least one `change` (on the resource's `changes` block or in the action itself).

Later, check_helper_mem_access(), under the case of\nPTR_TO_MAP_VALUE as register base type, it assumes BPF_READ for the\nsubsequent call to check_map_access_type() and given the BPF map is\nread-only it succeeds.\n\nThe helpers really need to be annotated as ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} | MEM_UNINIT\nwhen results are written into them as opposed to read out of them. The\nlatter indicates that it's okay to pass a pointer to uninitialized memory\nas the memory is written to anyway.\n\nHowever, ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} is a special case of ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM\njust with additional alignment requirement.

The leak occurs when multiple\nthreads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to\ninconsistent state and potential memory leaks.\n\nTo fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing\nvf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock),\nensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.\n\nAdditionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) in\ni40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.\n\nReproduction steps:\n1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them.\n2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting\n\tportvlan and/or mac filters).\n3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the\n\tmac_filter_hash.\n\nThis synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents\nthe described leak.",

The tunnel_dst is a metadata type\nof dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata->dst.dev is NULL.\n\nThen in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check\nfor frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the\nVxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call\nip_skb_dst_mtu.\n\nThe ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst\nwith valid dst->dev, thus the crash.\n\nThis case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet\ninstead.\n\nPING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) from 0.0.0.0 h1-eth0: 2000(2028) bytes of data.\n[  176.291791] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000110\n[  176.292101] Mem abort info:\n[  176.292184]   ESR = 0x0000000096000004\n[  176.292322]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  176.292530]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  176.292709]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  176.292862]   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault\n[  176.293013] Data abort info:\n[  176.293104]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  176.293488]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  176.293787]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  176.293995] user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000043ef5000\n[  176.294166] [0000000000000110] pgd=0000000000000000,\np4d=0000000000000000\n[  176.294827] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  176.295252] Modules linked in: vxlan ip6_udp_tunnel udp_tunnel veth\nbr_netfilter bridge stp llc ipv6 crct10dif_ce\n[  176.295923] CPU: 0 PID: 188 Comm: ping Not tainted\n6.8.0-rc3-g5b3fbd61b9d1 #2\n[  176.296314] Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n[  176.296535] pstate: 80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS\nBTYPE=--)\n[  176.296808] pc : br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x390/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.297382] lr : br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x2ac/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.297636] sp : ffff800080003630\n[  176.297743] x29: ffff800080003630 x28: 0000000000000008 x27:\nffff6828c49ad9f8\n[  176.298093] x26: ffff6828c49ad000 x25: 0000000000000000 x24:\n00000000000003e8\n[  176.298430] x23: 0000000000000000 x22: ffff6828c4960b40 x21:\nffff6828c3b16d28\n[  176.298652] x20: ffff6828c3167048 x19: ffff6828c3b16d00 x18:\n0000000000000014\n[  176.298926] x17: ffffb0476322f000 x16: ffffb7e164023730 x15:\n0000000095744632\n[  176.299296] x14: ffff6828c3f1c880 x13: 0000000000000002 x12:\nffffb7e137926a70\n[  176.299574] x11: 0000000000000001 x10: ffff6828c3f1c898 x9 :\n0000000000000000\n[  176.300049] x8 : ffff6828c49bf070 x7 : 0008460f18d5f20e x6 :\nf20e0100bebafeca\n[  176.300302] x5 : ffff6828c7f918fe x4 : ffff6828c49bf070 x3 :\n0000000000000000\n[  176.300586] x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : ffff6828c3c7ad00 x0 :\nffff6828c7f918f0\n[  176.300889] Call trace:\n[  176.301123]  br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x390/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.301411]  br_nf_post_routing+0x2a8/0x3e4 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.301703]  nf_hook_slow+0x48/0x124\n[  176.302060]  br_forward_finish+0xc8/0xe8 [bridge]\n[  176.302371]  br_nf_hook_thresh+0x124/0x134 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.302605]  br_nf_forward_finish+0x118/0x22c [br_netfilter]\n[  176.302824]  br_nf_forward_ip.part.0+0x264/0x290 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.303136]  br_nf_forward+0x2b8/0x4e0 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.303359]  nf_hook_slow+0x48/0x124\n[  176.303\n---truncated---",

If\nprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another\nkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be\nbypassed.\n\nFor example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter\nand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier\nassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's\nprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from\nthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent\nprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,\nthe bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,\nthat is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.\n\nAnother example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,\nand BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier\nknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for\nbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal\nfor file_alloc_security to return positive number.

For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered\nby the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called,\nwhich first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd(). \nmove_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and\ndestination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the\ndestination.\n\nThe problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page\ntable removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken\nafter the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it. \nSo we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the\nsame tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note\nthat process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it\nthrough the file rmap:\n\nprocess A                      process B\n=========                      =========\nmremap\n  mremap_to\n    move_vma\n      move_page_tables\n        get_old_pmd\n        alloc_new_pmd\n                      *** PREEMPT ***\n                               madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)\n                                 do_madvise\n                                   madvise_walk_vmas\n                                     madvise_vma_behavior\n                                       madvise_collapse\n                                         hpage_collapse_scan_file\n                                           collapse_file\n                                             retract_page_tables\n                                               i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)\n                                               pmdp_collapse_flush\n                                               i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)\n        move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)\n          take_rmap_locks\n          move_normal_pmd\n          drop_rmap_locks\n\nWhen this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries\nin the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect\ndepends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end\nup with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely\nexploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.\n\nFix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a\npage table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and\nlet the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then\nbail immediately at the pmd_none() check.\n\nBug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create\nshmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't\nzap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config\nflag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need\nshmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally\nrequires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags,\nwhich would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't\nknow if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like\nthat.\n\nBug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege\nescalation when it is reachable.",

Analyzing the core\ndump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved\non to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously\ndata->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in\ndata->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.\n\nWhat's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the\nwaitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding\nthat it already got a token and returning.

Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter\nand THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.\n\nFix it by swapping the order. We also need to use\nlist_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in\nfinish_wait().",

Both functions were originally written for\nuse with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes\nwas added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely\naccess user memory.\n\nThere are three key problems:\n\n1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and\n   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as\n   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which\n   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.\n   lockup or panic()).\n\n2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when\n   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory\n   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor\n   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a\n   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.\n\n3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,\n   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.\n   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the\n   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the\n   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1\n   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first\n   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.\n\n   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is\n   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no\n   worse than (1).\n\n   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or\n   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but\n   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would\n   require either:\n\n   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the\n     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.\n\n   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such\n     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of\n     the TTBR address range.\n\n   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there\n   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error\n   pointers.\n\nPractically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have\nbeen no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it\nappears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with\nuprobes.\n\nAvoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW\n(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and\nsimulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR\n(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as\narm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can\nconsider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but\nthis will require more significant work.",

It turns out that the problems are caused by a subtle\ndifference between the timer_pending() and hrtimer_active() APIs.\n\nThe changeover blindly replaced the first by the second.  However,\ntimer_pending() returns True when the timer is queued but not when its\ncallback is running, whereas hrtimer_active() returns True when the\nhrtimer is queued _or_ its callback is running.  This difference\noccasionally caused dummy_urb_enqueue() to think that the callback\nroutine had not yet started when in fact it was almost finished.  As a\nresult the hrtimer was not restarted, which made it impossible for the\ndriver to dequeue later the URB that was just enqueued.  This caused\nusb_kill_urb() to hang, and things got worse from there.\n\nSince hrtimers have no API for telling when they are queued and the\ncallback isn't running, the driver must keep track of this for itself.\nThat's what this patch does, adding a new \"timer_pending\" flag and\nsetting or clearing it at the appropriate times.",

Laundromat thread\nfinds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it\nmarks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list\nbut then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation\nhappens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing\nfree_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls\nlist_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees\nthe delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not\ncalling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation\nbut that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on\nthe file.\n\nNow, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that\nlease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends\nup trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid.

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put\non the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to\nmake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act\naccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before\nthe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove\nit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived\nbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state\nfreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.\n\nAlso, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,\nwe need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means\nthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this\ndelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not\nnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the\nlack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.",

This means that\nif skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,\nsubsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same\nbpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up\ncrashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.\n\nWith the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer\nshared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen\nanymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag\nvalues in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so\nthis patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and\nredefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap\nwith the flags used for XDP.

Through this bug, a BPF\nprogram can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,\n.rodata global maps.\n\nThe problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that \"the passed buffer\nto the BPF helper does not need to be initialized\" which was added back\nin commit 435faee1aae9 (\"bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type\")\ngot overloaded over time with \"the passed buffer is being written to\".\n\nThe problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later\nvia 06c1c049721a (\"bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory\") set meta\nto NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to\nthe helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses\nverifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only\nassumes the latter memory is read instead.\n\nFix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having\nMEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the\nBPF verifier checks for writing to memory.\n\nSome notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}\nwe can access fn->arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding\nARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed\naltogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the\nequivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg().",

This\nis the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k\nPTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is\nset up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make\nsemantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).\n\nMore precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),\nset_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success\n(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly\n\"work\" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),\nbut it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the\ndirect map.\n\nNote that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems\nwhere can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with\nCONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and\nCONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent\nfailure.

This may result in a few distinct problems:\n\n* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can\n  safely be probed.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an\n  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped\n  out-of-line safely.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to\n  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.\n\nThe endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:\n\n* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so\n  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian\n  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()\n  which similarly does not handle endianness.\n\n* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both\n  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]\n  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.\n  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.\n\nFix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and\nadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming\nthe instruction encoding.

      "cveDis": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmaple_tree: correct tree corruption on spanning store\n\nPatch series \"maple_tree: correct tree corruption on spanning store\", v3.\n\nThere has been a nasty yet subtle maple tree corruption bug that appears\nto have been in existence since the inception of the algorithm.\n\nThis bug seems far more likely to happen since commit f8d112a4e657\n(\"mm/mmap: avoid zeroing vma tree in mmap_region()\"), which is the point\nat which reports started to be submitted concerning this bug.\n\nWe were made definitely aware of the bug thanks to the kind efforts of\nBert Karwatzki who helped enormously in my being able to track this down\nand identify the cause of it.\n\nThe bug arises when an attempt is made to perform a spanning store across\ntwo leaf nodes, where the right leaf node is the rightmost child of the\nshared parent, AND the store completely consumes the right-mode node.\n\nThis results in mas_wr_spanning_store() mitakenly duplicating the new and\nexisting entries at the maximum pivot within the range, and thus maple\ntree corruption.\n\nThe fix patch corrects this by detecting this scenario and disallowing the\nmistaken duplicate copy.\n\nThe fix patch commit message goes into great detail as to how this occurs.\n\nThis series also includes a test which reliably reproduces the issue, and\nasserts that the fix works correctly.\n\nBert has kindly tested the fix and confirmed it resolved his issues.  Also\nMikhail Gavrilov kindly reported what appears to be precisely the same\nbug, which this fix should also resolve.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThere has been a subtle bug present in the maple tree implementation from\nits inception.\n\nThis arises from how stores are performed - when a store occurs, it will\noverwrite overlapping ranges and adjust the tree as necessary to\naccommodate this.\n\nA range may always ultimately span two leaf nodes.  In this instance we\nwalk the two leaf nodes, determine which elements are not overwritten to\nthe left and to the right of the start and end of the ranges respectively\nand then rebalance the tree to contain these entries and the newly\ninserted one.\n\nThis kind of store is dubbed a 'spanning store' and is implemented by\nmas_wr_spanning_store().\n\nIn order to reach this stage, mas_store_gfp() invokes\nmas_wr_preallocate(), mas_wr_store_type() and mas_wr_walk() in turn to\nwalk the tree and update the object (mas) to traverse to the location\nwhere the write should be performed, determining its store type.\n\nWhen a spanning store is required, this function returns false stopping at\nthe parent node which contains the target range, and mas_wr_store_type()\nmarks the mas->store_type as wr_spanning_store to denote this fact.\n\nWhen we go to perform the store in mas_wr_spanning_store(), we first\ndetermine the elements AFTER the END of the range we wish to store (that\nis, to the right of the entry to be inserted) - we do this by walking to\nthe NEXT pivot in the tree (i.e.  r_mas.last + 1), starting at the node we\nhave just determined contains the range over which we intend to write.\n\nWe then turn our attention to the entries to the left of the entry we are\ninserting, whose state is represented by l_mas, and copy these into a 'big\nnode', which is a special node which contains enough slots to contain two\nleaf node's worth of data.\n\nWe then copy the entry we wish to store immediately after this - the copy\nand the insertion of the new entry is performed by mas_store_b_node().\n\nAfter this we copy the elements to the right of the end of the range which\nwe are inserting, if we have not exceeded the length of the node (i.e. \nr_mas.offset <= r_mas.end).\n\nHerein lies the bug - under very specific circumstances, this logic can\nbreak and corrupt the maple tree.\n\nConsider the following tree:\n\nHeight\n  0                             Root Node\n                                 /      \\\n                 pivot = 0xffff /        \\ pivot = ULONG_MAX\n                               /          \n---truncated---",

      "cveDis": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix error propagation of split bios\n\nThe purpose of btrfs_bbio_propagate_error() shall be propagating an error\nof split bio to its original btrfs_bio, and tell the error to the upper\nlayer. However, it's not working well on some cases.\n\n* Case 1. Immediate (or quick) end_bio with an error\n\nWhen btrfs sends btrfs_bio to mirrored devices, btrfs calls\nbtrfs_bio_end_io() when all the mirroring bios are completed. If that\nbtrfs_bio was split, it is from btrfs_clone_bioset and its end_io function\nis btrfs_orig_write_end_io. For this case, btrfs_bbio_propagate_error()\naccesses the orig_bbio's bio context to increase the error count.\n\nThat works well in most cases. However, if the end_io is called enough\nfast, orig_bbio's (remaining part after split) bio context may not be\nproperly set at that time. Since the bio context is set when the orig_bbio\n(the last btrfs_bio) is sent to devices, that might be too late for earlier\nsplit btrfs_bio's completion.  That will result in NULL pointer\ndereference.\n\nThat bug is easily reproducible by running btrfs/146 on zoned devices [1]\nand it shows the following trace.\n\n[1] You need raid-stripe-tree feature as it create \"-d raid0 -m raid1\" FS.\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 0 P4D 0\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 13 Comm: kworker/u32:1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7-BTRFS-ZNS+ #474\n  Hardware name: Bochs Bochs, BIOS Bochs 01/01/2011\n  Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-5)\n  RIP: 0010:btrfs_bio_end_io+0xae/0xc0 [btrfs]\n  BTRFS error (device dm-0): bdev /dev/mapper/error-test errs: wr 2, rd 0, flush 0, corrupt 0, gen 0\n  RSP: 0018:ffffc9000006f248 EFLAGS: 00010246\n  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff888005a7f080 RCX: ffffc9000006f1dc\n  RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 000000000000000a RDI: ffff888005a7f080\n  RBP: ffff888011dfc540 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000001\n  R10: ffffffff82e508e0 R11: 0000000000000005 R12: ffff88800ddfbe58\n  R13: ffff888005a7f080 R14: ffff888005a7f158 R15: ffff888005a7f158\n  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88803ea80000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 0000000000000020 CR3: 0000000002e22006 CR4: 0000000000370ef0\n  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   ? __die_body.cold+0x19/0x26\n   ? page_fault_oops+0x13e/0x2b0\n   ? _printk+0x58/0x73\n   ? do_user_addr_fault+0x5f/0x750\n   ? exc_page_fault+0x76/0x240\n   ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30\n   ? btrfs_bio_end_io+0xae/0xc0 [btrfs]\n   ? btrfs_log_dev_io_error+0x7f/0x90 [btrfs]\n   btrfs_orig_write_end_io+0x51/0x90 [btrfs]\n   dm_submit_bio+0x5c2/0xa50 [dm_mod]\n   ? find_held_lock+0x2b/0x80\n   ? blk_try_enter_queue+0x90/0x1e0\n   __submit_bio+0xe0/0x130\n   ? ktime_get+0x10a/0x160\n   ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x74/0x100\n   submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x199/0x410\n   btrfs_submit_bio+0x7d/0x150 [btrfs]\n   btrfs_submit_chunk+0x1a1/0x6d0 [btrfs]\n   ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x74/0x100\n   ? __folio_start_writeback+0x10/0x2c0\n   btrfs_submit_bbio+0x1c/0x40 [btrfs]\n   submit_one_bio+0x44/0x60 [btrfs]\n   submit_extent_folio+0x13f/0x330 [btrfs]\n   ? btrfs_set_range_writeback+0xa3/0xd0 [btrfs]\n   extent_writepage_io+0x18b/0x360 [btrfs]\n   extent_write_locked_range+0x17c/0x340 [btrfs]\n   ? __pfx_end_bbio_data_write+0x10/0x10 [btrfs]\n   run_delalloc_cow+0x71/0xd0 [btrfs]\n   btrfs_run_delalloc_range+0x176/0x500 [btrfs]\n   ? find_lock_delalloc_range+0x119/0x260 [btrfs]\n   writepage_delalloc+0x2ab/0x480 [btrfs]\n   extent_write_cache_pages+0x236/0x7d0 [btrfs]\n   btrfs_writepages+0x72/0x130 [btrfs]\n   do_writepages+0xd4/0x240\n   ? find_held_lock+0x2b/0x80\n   ? wbc_attach_and_unlock_inode+0x12c/0x290\n   ? wbc_attach_and_unlock_inode+0x12c/0x29\n---truncated---",

At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3\ntrips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been\ndeleted.\n\nThe fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no\nmandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces\nin-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit.

In\nother words if decoders are allocated 0->1->2 and disabled 1->2->0 then\nport->commit_end only decrements from 2 after 2 has been disabled, and\nit decrements all the way to zero since 1 was disabled previously.",

This is catastrophic for data integrity when iter->pos is not\naligned to a page, because daddr/saddr do not point to the same byte in\nthe file as iter->pos.  Hence we corrupt user data by copying it to the\nwrong place.\n\nIf iter->pos + iomap_length() in the _iter function not aligned to a\npage, then we fail to copy a full block, and only partially populate the\ndestination block.  This is catastrophic for data confidentiality\nbecause we expose stale pmem contents.\n\nFix both of these issues by aligning copy_pos/copy_len to a page\nboundary (remember, this is fsdax so 1 fsblock == 1 base page) so that\nwe always copy full blocks.\n\nWe're not done yet -- there's no call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range,\nso programs that have the file range mmap'd will continue accessing the\nold memory mapping after the file metadata updates have completed.\n\nBe careful with the return value -- if the unshare succeeds, we still\nneed to return the number of bytes that the iomap iter thinks we're\noperating on.",

However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if\noverride_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  \n\nFor example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV\nsignal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the\nsignal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. \nThis prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and\nhandling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are\nunaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is\neffectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and\ncrashes, as we observed with java applications.\n\nFix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip\nthe comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.

Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the\n   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.\n2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.\n\nThe reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:\n1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the\n   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta\n   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to\n   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,\n   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a\n   keyring.\n2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.\n   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as\n   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.\n3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT\n   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits\n   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that\n   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a\n   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points\n   to a shortcut.\n\n                      NODE A\n              +------>+---+\n      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 | f |\n      +---+\n\n4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,\n   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read\n   out-of-bounds read.\n\nTo fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a\nshortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/1cfa878e-8c7b-4570-8606-21daf5e13ce7@huaweicloud.com/\n\n[jarkko: tweaked the commit message a bit to have an appropriate closes\n tag.]",

The way HTTP headers are added to a request is via the `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method. This method does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This means that any headers added to a refit request are vulnerable to CRLF-injection. In general, CRLF-injection into a HTTP header (when using HTTP/1.1) means that one can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests. If an application using the Refit library passes a user-controllable value through to a header, then that application becomes vulnerable to CRLF-injection. This is not necessarily a security issue for a command line application like the one above, but if such code were present in a web application then it becomes vulnerable to request splitting (as shown in the PoC) and thus Server Side Request Forgery. Strictly speaking this is a potential vulnerability in applications using Refit and not in Refit itself. This issue has been addressed in release version 8.0.0 and all users are advised to upgrade.

Default configuration honors X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to read client's IP address. X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy servers to identify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretending that the request comes from a different IP address.

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be.

If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience).

The parameters used for the search are the public key and the payload. The search API returns entries that match either condition rather than both. When gitsign's credential cache is used, there can be multiple entries that use the same ephemeral keypair / signing certificate. As gitsign assumes both conditions are matched by Rekor, there is no additional validation that the entry's hash matches the payload being verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification.

All Filament features that interact with storage use the `default_filesystem_disk` config option. This allows the user to easily swap their storage driver to something production-ready like `s3` when deploying their app, without having to touch multiple configuration options and potentially forgetting about some. The default disk is set to `public` when you first install Filament, since this allows users to quickly get started developing with a functional disk that allows features such as file upload previews locally without the need to set up an S3 disk with temporary URL support. However, some features of Filament such as exports also rely on storage, and the files that are stored contain data that should often not be public. This is not an issue for the many deployed applications, since many use a secure default disk such as S3 in production. However, [CWE-1188](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) suggests that having the `public` disk as the default disk in Filament is a security vulnerability itself. As such, we have implemented a measure to protect users whereby if the `public` disk is set as the default disk, the exports feature will automatically swap it out for the `local` disk, if that exists. Users who set the default disk to `local` or `s3` already are not affected. If a user wants to continue to use the `public` disk for exports, they can by setting the export disk deliberately. This change has been included in the 3.2.123 release and all users who use the `public` disk are advised to upgrade.",

The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily weak passwords by bypassing client-side validation. While the UI enforces password complexity requirements, direct API calls can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts with passwords as short as a single character. When an email messaging provider is enabled and a new user account is created in the system, an invite email containing a special link is sent to the new user's email address. This link directs the new user to a page where they can set their initial password. While the user interface implements password complexity checks, these validations are only performed client-side. The underlying `/api/v1/user/accept-invite` API endpoint does not implement the same password policy validations. This vulnerability allows an invited user to set an extremely weak password for their own account during the initial account setup process. Therefore that specific user's account can be compromised easily by an attacker guessing or brute forcing the password. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.50.0`.

Prior to version 2.13.0, the multipart form parser shipped with litestar expects the entire request body as a single byte string and there is no default limit for the total size of the request body.

The multipart form parser in affected versions is vulnerable to this type of attack by design.

Prior to version 0.4.0, the HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users relying on lxml_html_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content. Users employing the HTML cleaner in a security-sensitive context should upgrade to lxml 0.4.0, which addresses this issue. As a temporary mitigation, users can configure lxml_html_clean with the following settings to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. Via `remove_tags`, one may specify tags to remove - their content is moved to their parents' tags. Via `kill_tags`, one may specify tags to be removed completely. Via `allow_tags`, one may restrict the set of permissible tags, excluding context-switching tags like `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`.",

By abusing this functionality, it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL, whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally, the library does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However, this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application, as long as their content type is text based. If not, the request is still sent, but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.",

However, this causes us to also skip `ngtcp2_pkt_validate_ack`. The ack which was skipped still got written to qlog. The bug occurs in `ngtcp2_qlog::write_ack_frame`. It is now possible to reach this code with an invalid ack, suppose `largest_ack=0` and `first_ack_range=15`. Subtracting `largest_ack - first_ack_range` will lead to an integer underflow which is 20 chars long. However, the ngtcp2 qlog code assumes the number written is a signed integer and only accounts for 19 characters of overhead (see `NGTCP2_QLOG_ACK_FRAME_RANGE_OVERHEAD`). Therefore, we overwrite the buffer causing a heap overflow. This is high priority and could potentially impact many users if they enable qlog. qlog is disabled by default. Due to its overhead, it is most likely used for debugging purpose, but the actual use is unknown. ngtcp2 v1.9.1 fixes the bug and users are advised to upgrade.

The labels should be named after what\n  they do, not after the error path that jumps to them. This way, it is\n  obviously wrong that two labels pointing to the same code mean\n  something is wrong, and checking the code correctness at the goto site\n  is also easier ]",

A large number of cpuset cgroups are deleted.\n2. Set cpu on and off repeatly.\n3. Set watchdog_thresh repeatly.\nThe scripts can be obtained at LINK mentioned above the signature.\n\nThe reason for this issue is cgroup_mutex and cpu_hotplug_lock are\nacquired in different tasks, which may lead to deadlock.\nIt can lead to a deadlock through the following steps:\n1. A large number of cpusets are deleted asynchronously, which puts a\n   large number of cgroup_bpf_release works into system_wq. The max_active\n   of system_wq is WQ_DFL_ACTIVE(256). Consequently, all active works are\n   cgroup_bpf_release works, and many cgroup_bpf_release works will be put\n   into inactive queue. As illustrated in the diagram, there are 256 (in\n   the acvtive queue) + n (in the inactive queue) works.\n2. Setting watchdog_thresh will hold cpu_hotplug_lock.read and put\n   smp_call_on_cpu work into system_wq. However step 1 has already filled\n   system_wq, 'sscs.work' is put into inactive queue. 'sscs.work' has\n   to wait until the works that were put into the inacvtive queue earlier\n   have executed (n cgroup_bpf_release), so it will be blocked for a while.\n3. Cpu offline requires cpu_hotplug_lock.write, which is blocked by step 2.\n4. Cpusets that were deleted at step 1 put cgroup_release works into\n   cgroup_destroy_wq. They are competing to get cgroup_mutex all the time.\n   When cgroup_metux is acqured by work at css_killed_work_fn, it will\n   call cpuset_css_offline, which needs to acqure cpu_hotplug_lock.read.\n   However, cpuset_css_offline will be blocked for step 3.\n5.

Now things will go\nhorribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory\nregion, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be\ntriggered :(\n\nIn contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly\nas expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged\ndata and paged frags actually.\n\nThis patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index\nfor tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.\n\nTested and verified on DWXGMAC CORE 3.20a",

For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET,\n   panthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear\n   VM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping\n   writable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha.\n   I don't think this actually has any impact in practice:\n   When the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and\n   when the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the\n   driver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing\n   writing to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more*\n   flushes happen.\n\n2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are\n   mappings without the VM_SHARED flag).\n   MAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has\n   copy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but\n   fairly cursed.\n   In particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs\n   during mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range()\n   wants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into\n   the vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault\n   handler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so\n   if you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when\n   it hits a BUG() check.\n\nFix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_ID\ndoesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics for\nthe FLUSH_ID don't make sense).\n\nReproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailing\nlist; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine.\n\nNote that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don't\nhave a working kernel build setup for the test machine yet.

The relevant recent\nchanges being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin,\nimproved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting.\n\nBefore fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(),\nwhich does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(),\nwhich is what it does.  But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm\ninternals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to\ncheck usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued,\nwhich can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing\ncallers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).\n\nJust omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all\nof whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page()\nwill tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no\nlonger has any callers (and will be deleted separately).\n\nSwapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio->memcg_data 0\nwithout checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list;\nwhich is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg\n(when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later,\nwhen freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially\ncorrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0\nhere, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before\nresetting memcg_data.\n\nThat goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 (\"mm: thp: make deferred split\nshrinker memcg aware\"): which included a check on swapcache before adding\nto deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to\nswapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim\n(though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue\ncould have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 (\"mm: split\nunderused THPs\") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes\nswapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.\n\nKeep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is\nno longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely\nto be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the\nqueue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.\n\nMemcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing\nfolio->memcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the\ndeferred list, sometimes corrupting \"from\" memcg's list, like swapout. \nRefcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be\nused in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier:\nmem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting\nof course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving\ncharge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later:\nnobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.\n\nThe 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list\nto another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0);\nbut that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 (\"mm: thp: don't need care\ndeferred split queue in memcg charge move path\"), which argued that the\nexistence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred\nlist.  As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false.\n\nBackport to 6.11 should be straightforward.  Earlier backports must take\ncare that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included.  There\nis not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases.",

[0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

We preallocate memory for the iterator before we call the file-backed\n   memory hook, allowing us to exit early and avoid having to perform\n   complicated and error-prone close/free logic. We carefully free\n   iterator state on both success and error paths.\n\n2. The enclosing mmap_region() function handles the mapping_map_writable()\n   logic early. Previously the logic had the mapping_map_writable() at the\n   point of mapping a newly allocated file-backed VMA, and a matching\n   mapping_unmap_writable() on success and error paths.\n\n   We now do this unconditionally if this is a file-backed, shared writable\n   mapping. If a driver changes the flags to eliminate VM_MAYWRITE, however\n   doing so does not invalidate the seal check we just performed, and we in\n   any case always decrement the counter in the wrapper.\n\n   We perform a debug assert to ensure a driver does not attempt to do the\n   opposite.\n\n3. We also move arch_validate_flags() up into the mmap_region()\n   function. This is only relevant on arm64 and sparc64, and the check is\n   only meaningful for SPARC with ADI enabled. We explicitly add a warning\n   for this arch if a driver invalidates this check, though the code ought\n   eventually to be fixed to eliminate the need for this.\n\nWith all of these measures in place, we no longer need to explicitly close\nthe VMA on error paths, as we place all checks which might fail prior to a\ncall to any driver mmap hook.\n\nThis eliminates an entire class of errors, makes the code easier to reason\nabout and more robust.",

This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below:\n\nCall Trace:\n    autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable)\n    __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c\n    blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84\n    blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x140/0x220\n    nvme_keep_alive_work+0xc8/0x19c [nvme_core]\n    process_one_work+0x200/0x4e0\n    worker_thread+0x340/0x504\n    kthread+0x138/0x140\n    start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18\n\nWhile shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks\nin then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is\nthen invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which\ndecrements the admin->q_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only\nrequest in the admin queue then the admin->q_usage_counter becomes zero.\nIf that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_\nqueue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another\ncpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward\nprogress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward\nwe are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the\nissue here's that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue\ndispatch operation hasn't yet finished its work and so it could still\npotentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had\nbeen already deleted and that causes the above crash.\n\nThis fix helps avoid the observed crash by implementing keep-alive as a\nsynchronous operation so that we decrement admin->q_usage_counter only\nafter keep-alive command finished its execution and returns the command\nstatus back up to its caller (blk_execute_rq()). This would ensure that\nfabric shutdown code path doesn't destroy the fabric admin queue until\nkeep-alive request finished execution and also keep-alive thread is not\nrunning hw/hctx queue dispatch operation.",

It provides the families\nthe following ops:\n - start - (optional) kicks off the dumping process\n - dump  - actual dump helper, keeps getting called until it returns 0\n - done  - (optional) pairs with .start, can be used for cleanup\nThe whole process is asynchronous and the repeated calls to .dump\ndon't actually happen in a tight loop, but rather are triggered\nin response to recvmsg() on the socket.\n\nThis gives the user full control over the dump, but also means that\nthe user can close the socket without getting to the end of the dump.\nTo make sure .start is always paired with .done we check if there\nis an ongoing dump before freeing the socket, and if so call .done.\n\nThe complication is that sockets can get freed from BH and .done\nis allowed to sleep. So we use a workqueue to defer the call, when\nneeded.\n\nUnfortunately this does not work correctly. What we defer is not\nthe cleanup but rather releasing a reference on the socket.\nWe have no guarantee that we own the last reference, if someone\nelse holds the socket they may release it in BH and we're back\nto square one.\n\nThe whole dance, however, appears to be unnecessary. Only the user\ncan interact with dumps, so we can clean up when socket is closed.\nAnd close always happens in process context. Some async code may\nstill access the socket after close, queue notification skbs to it etc.\nbut no dumps can start, end or otherwise make progress.\n\nDelete the workqueue and flush the dump state directly from the release\nhandler. Note that further cleanup is possible in -next, for instance\nwe now always call .done before releasing the main module reference,\nso dump doesn't have to take a reference of its own.",

A malicious actor using a compromised identity may want to do this to prevent discovery via rekor's log monitors. The signer's identity will still be available to the verifier. The signature on the bundle must still be on the correct artifact for the verifier to pass. sigstore-gradle-plugin and sigstore-maven-plugin are not affected by this as they only provide signing functionality. This issue has been patched in v1.1.0 release with PR #856. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

This issue arises due to improper sanitization of the URL parameters, allowing the URL bar's contents to be injected and reflected into the HTML page. An attacker could craft a malicious URL to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of a victim who visits the link. Any application utilizing this authentication library is vulnerable. Users of the application are at risk if they can be lured into clicking on a crafted malicious link. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.5.5 by ensuring proper sanitization and escaping of user input in the affected URL parameters. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade. If upgrading is not immediately possible, users can implement the following workarounds: 1. Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests containing suspicious URL parameters. or 2. Apply input validation and escaping directly within the application’s middleware or reverse proxy layer, specifically targeting the affected parameters.",

A path traversal vulnerability exists in the backup export functionality of EDDI, as implemented in `RestExportService.java`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `botFilename` parameter in requests. The application fails to sanitize user input, enabling malicious inputs such as `..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` to access arbitrary files. However, the **severity of this vulnerability is significantly limited** because EDDI typically runs within a **Docker container**, which provides additional layers of isolation and restricted permissions. As a result, while this vulnerability exposes files within the container, it does not inherently threaten the underlying host system or other containers. A patch is required to sanitize and validate the botFilename input parameter. Users should ensure they are using version 5.4 which contains this patdch. For temporary mitigation, access to the vulnerable endpoint should be restricted through firewall rules or authentication mechanisms.",

This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL, e.g., `https://example.evil.org/schema.json`, they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used instead of the appropriate schema. Such a cache confusion attack could be used to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected. This issue has been patched in version 0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. A few workarounds exist: 1. Users can use `--no-cache` to disable caching. 2. Users can use `--cache-filename` to select filenames for use in the cache, or to ensure that other usages do not overwrite the cached schema. (Note: this flag is being deprecated as part of the remediation effort.) 3.

      "cveDis": "The gh cli is GitHub’s official command line tool. A security vulnerability has been identified in the GitHub CLI that could leak authentication tokens when cloning repositories containing `git` submodules hosted outside of GitHub.com and ghe.com. This vulnerability stems from several `gh` commands used to clone a repository with submodules from a non-GitHub host including `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout`. These GitHub CLI commands invoke git with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the `credential.helper` configuration variable for any host encountered. Prior to version `2.63.0`, hosts other than GitHub.com and ghe.com are treated as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts and have tokens sourced from the following environment variables before falling back to host-specific tokens stored within system-specific secured storage: 1. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, 2. `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` and 3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the `CODESPACES` environment variable is set. The result being `git` sending authentication tokens when cloning submodules. In version `2.63.0`, these GitHub CLI commands will limit the hosts for which `gh` acts as a credential helper to source authentication tokens. Additionally, `GITHUB_TOKEN` will only be used for GitHub.com and ghe.com. Users are advised to upgrade. Additionally users are advised to revoke authentication tokens used with the GitHub CLI and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise",

No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8, the auth check was accidentally removed on the GET Workflow endpoint's fallback to archived workflows on these lines, allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token.

A malicious actor can send a IEEE 802.15.4 packet with spoofed length byte and optionally spoofed FCS, which eventually results into an endless loop on a CC2538 as receiver. Before PR #20998, the receiver would check for the location of the CRC bit using the packet length byte by considering all 8 bits, instead of discarding bit 7, which is what the radio does. This then results into reading outside of the RX FIFO.  Although it prints an error when attempting to read outside of the RX FIFO, it will continue doing this. This may lead to a discrepancy in the CRC check according to the firmware and the radio. If the CPU judges the CRC as correct and the radio is set to `AUTO_ACK`, when the packet requests and acknowledgment the CPU will go into the state `CC2538_STATE_TX_ACK`. However, if the radio judged the CRC as incorrect, it will not send an acknowledgment, and thus the `TXACKDONE` event will not fire. It will then never return to the state `CC2538_STATE_READY` since the baseband processing is still disabled. Then the CPU will be in an endless loop. Since setting to idle is not forced, it won't do it if the radio's state is not `CC2538_STATE_READY`. A fix has not yet been made.",

An implementation bug in the Kolide Agent (known as `launcher`) allows for local privilege escalation to the SYSTEM user on Windows 10 and 11. The bug was introduced in version 1.5.3 when launcher started storing upgraded binaries in the ProgramData directory. This move to the new directory meant the launcher root directory inherited default permissions that are not as strict as the previous location. These incorrect default permissions in conjunction with an omitted SystemDrive environmental variable (when launcher starts osqueryd), allows a malicious actor with access to the local Windows device to successfully place an arbitrary DLL into the osqueryd process's search path. Under some circumstances, this DLL will be executed when osqueryd performs a WMI query. This combination of events could then allow the attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM. Impacted versions include versions >= 1.5.3 and the fix has been released in 1.12.3.",

This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.
