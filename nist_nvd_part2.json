In affected versions if there are two overlapping policies for the `update` action that allow access to different fields, instead of correctly checking access permissions against the item they apply for the user is allowed to update the superset of fields allowed by any of the policies. E.g. have one policy allowing update access to `field_a` if the `id == 1` and one policy allowing update access to `field_b` if the `id == 2`. The user with both these policies is allowed to update both `field_a` and `field_b` for the items with ids `1` and `2`. Before v11, if a user was allowed to update an item they were allowed to update the fields that the single permission, that applied to that item, listed. With overlapping permissions this isn't as clear cut anymore and the union of fields might not be the fields the user is allowed to update for that specific item. The solution that this PR introduces is to evaluate the permissions for each field that the user tries to update in the validateItemAccess DB query, instead of only verifying access to the item as a whole. This is done by, instead of returning the actual field value, returning a flag that indicates if the user has access to that field. This uses the same case/when mechanism that is used for stripping out non permitted field that is at the core of the permissions engine. As a result, for every item that the access is validated for, the expected result is an item that has either 1 or null for all the \"requested\" fields instead of any of the actual field values. These results are not useful for anything other than verifying the field level access permissions. The final check in validateItemAccess can either fail if the number of items does not match the number of items the access is checked for (ie. the user does not have access to the item at all) or if not all of the passed in fields have access permissions for any of the returned items. This is a vulnerability that allows update access to unintended fields, potentially impacting the password field for user accounts.

During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop. For SArrays on the other hand, `iter_list` is instantiated in the body of a `repeat` ir, so it can be evaluated several times. This issue is being addressed and is expected to be available in version 0.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the patched release is available.

Prior to version 1.21, the LocalS3 service's bucket creation endpoint is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

This allows an attacker to declare an external entity that references an internal URL, which the server will then attempt to fetch when parsing the XML. The vulnerability specifically occurs in the location constraint processing, where the XML parser resolves external entities without proper validation or restrictions. When the external entity is resolved, the server makes an HTTP request to the specified URL and includes the response content in the parsed XML document. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal services or resources that should not be accessible from external networks.

Prior to version 1.1.21, the application is vulnerable to an open redirect due to improper validation of the callbackURL parameter in the email verification endpoint and any other endpoint that accepts callback url. While the server blocks fully qualified URLs, it incorrectly allows scheme-less URLs. This results in the browser interpreting the URL as a fully qualified URL, leading to unintended redirection. An attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious verification link and tricking users into clicking it. Upon successful email verification, the user will be automatically redirected to the attacker's website, which can be used for phishing, malware distribution, or stealing sensitive authentication tokens. This CVE is a bypass of the fix for GHSA-8jhw-6pjj-8723/CVE-2024-56734. Version 1.1.21 contains an updated patch.",

On Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. This library initialization could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. Gradle builds that rely on versions of net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to 0.22-milestone-28 could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory.\n\nIn net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to version 0.22-milestone-28, if the `Native.get(Class<>)` method was called, without calling `Native.init(File)` first, with a non-`null` argument used as working file path, then the library would initialize itself using the system temporary directory and NativeLibraryLocator.java lines 68 through 78. Version 0.22-milestone-28 has been released with changes that fix the problem. Initialization is now mandatory and no longer uses the system temporary directory, unless such a path is passed for initialization. The only workaround for affected versions is to make sure to do a proper initialization, using a location that is safe.\n\nGradle 8.12, only that exact version, had codepaths where the initialization of the underlying native integration library took a default path, relying on copying the binaries to the system temporary directory. Any execution of Gradle exposed this exploit. Users of Windows or modern versions of macOS are not vulnerable, nor are users of a Unix-like operating system with the \"sticky\" bit set or `noexec` on their system temporary directory vulnerable. This problem was fixed in Gradle 8.12.1. Gradle 8.13 release also upgrades to a version of the native library that no longer has that bug. Some workarounds are available. On Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the \"sticky\" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. Mounting `/tmp` as `noexec` will prevent Gradle 8.12 from starting. Those who are are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property java.io.tmpdir. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only.",

Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to \nRELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the client's key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups).

Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket.

This allows session token replacement for applications hosted on sibling subdomains (e.g., `community.host.com`) if session tokens aren't rotated post-authentication. Key Constraints are that the attacker must control any subdomain under the parent domain (e.g., `evil.host.com` or `x.y.host.com`), and the parent domain must not be on the Public Suffix List. Due to non-existent session token rotation after authenticating we can theoretically reproduce the vulnerability by using browser dev tools, but due to the browser's security measures this does not seem to be exploitable as described.

In versions 0.7.6b0 and prior, the `secure_redundant_execution` function in feldman_vss.py attempts to mitigate fault injection attacks by executing a function multiple times and comparing results. However, several critical weaknesses exist. Python's execution environment cannot guarantee true isolation between redundant executions, the constant-time comparison implementation in Python is subject to timing variations, the randomized execution order and timing provide insufficient protection against sophisticated fault attacks, and the error handling may leak timing information about partial execution results. These limitations make the protection ineffective against targeted fault injection attacks, especially from attackers with physical access to the hardware. A successful fault injection attack could allow an attacker to bypass the redundancy check mechanisms, extract secret polynomial coefficients during share generation or verification, force the acceptance of invalid shares during verification, and/or manipulate the commitment verification process to accept fraudulent commitments. This undermines the core security guarantees of the Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. Long-term remediation requires reimplementing the security-critical functions in a lower-level language like Rust. Short-term mitigations include deploying the software in environments with physical security controls, increasing the redundancy count (from 5 to a higher number) by modifying the source code, adding external verification of cryptographic operations when possible, considering using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key operations.",

      "cveDis": "Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.7.6b0 and prior, the `feldman_vss` library contains timing side-channel vulnerabilities in its matrix operations, specifically within the `_find_secure_pivot` function and potentially other parts of `_secure_matrix_solve`. These vulnerabilities are due to Python's execution model, which does not guarantee constant-time execution. An attacker with the ability to measure the execution time of these functions (e.g., through repeated calls with carefully crafted inputs) could potentially recover secret information used in the Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. The `_find_secure_pivot` function, used during Gaussian elimination in `_secure_matrix_solve`, attempts to find a non-zero pivot element. However, the conditional statement `if matrix[row][col] != 0 and row_random < min_value:` has execution time that depends on the value of `matrix[row][col]`. This timing difference can be exploited by an attacker. The `constant_time_compare` function in this file also does not provide a constant-time guarantee. The Python implementation of matrix operations in the _find_secure_pivot and _secure_matrix_solve functions cannot guarantee constant-time execution, potentially leaking information about secret polynomial coefficients. An attacker with the ability to make precise timing measurements of these operations could potentially extract secret information through statistical analysis of execution times, though practical exploitation would require significant expertise and controlled execution environments. Successful exploitation of these timing side-channels could allow an attacker to recover secret keys or other sensitive information protected by the VSS scheme. This could lead to a complete compromise of the shared secret. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. As acknowledged in the library's documentation, these vulnerabilities cannot be adequately addressed in pure Python. In the short term, consider using this library only in environments where timing measurements by attackers are infeasible. In the medium term, implement your own wrappers around critical operations using constant-time libraries in languages like Rust, Go, or C. In the long term, wait for the planned Rust implementation mentioned in the library documentation that will properly address these issues.",

      "cveDis": "The Bare Metal Operator (BMO) implements a Kubernetes API for managing bare metal hosts in Metal3. Baremetal Operator enables users to load Secret from arbitrary namespaces upon deployment of the namespace scoped Custom Resource `BMCEventSubscription`. Prior to versions 0.8.1 and 0.9.1, an adversary Kubernetes account with only namespace level roles (e.g. a tenant controlling a namespace) may create a `BMCEventSubscription` in his authorized namespace and then load Secrets from his unauthorized namespaces to his authorized namespace via the Baremetal Operator, causing Secret Leakage. The patch makes BMO refuse to read Secrets from other namespace than where the corresponding BMH resource is. The patch does not change the `BMCEventSubscription` API in BMO, but stricter validation will fail the request at admission time. It will also prevent the controller reading such Secrets, in case the BMCES CR has already been deployed. The issue exists for all versions of BMO, and is patched in BMO releases v0.9.1 and v0.8.1. Prior upgrading to patched BMO version, duplicate any existing Secret pointed to by `BMCEventSubscription`'s `httpHeadersRef` to the same namespace where the corresponding BMH exists. After upgrade, remove the old Secrets. As a workaround, the operator can configure BMO RBAC to be namespace scoped, instead of cluster scoped, to prevent BMO from accessing Secrets from other namespaces, and/or use `WATCH_NAMESPACE` configuration option to limit BMO to single namespace.",

      "cveDis": "Expr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.0, if the Expr expression parser is given an unbounded input string, it will attempt to compile the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression. In scenarios where input size isn’t limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings that your application will accept. For example, set a maximum allowable number of characters (or nodes) for any expression and reject or truncate inputs that exceed this limit. By ensuring no unbounded-length expression is ever fed into the parser, one can prevent the parser from constructing a pathologically large AST and avoid potential memory exhaustion. In short, pre-validate and cap input size as a safeguard in the absence of the patch.",

Such servers could abuse the unbounded deserialization in the client to provide malicious responses that may eventually cause arbitrary code execution on the client. Version 2.1.0 introduced a allow/denylist feature to restrict deserialization, but this feature could be bypassed.\n\nThe .NET team has deprecated the built-in .NET binary serialization feature starting with .NET 9 and suggests migrating away from binary serialization. The project is considering to follow suit and drop this part of the NMS API altogether.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1, which fixes the issue. We also recommend to migrate away from relying on .NET binary serialization as a hardening method for the future.",

Besu 24.7.1 through 25.2.2, corresponding to besu-native versions 0.9.0 through 1.2.1, have a potential consensus bug for the precompiles ALTBN128_ADD (0x06), ALTBN128_MUL (0x07), and ALTBN128_PAIRING (0x08). These precompiles were reimplemented in besu-native using gnark-crypto's bn254 implementation, as the former implementation used a library which was no longer maintained and not sufficiently performant. The new gnark implementation was initially added in version 0.9.0 of besu-native but was not utilized by Besu until version 0.9.2 in Besu 24.7.1. The issue is that there are EC points which may be crafted which are in the correct subgroup but are not on the curve and the besu-native gnark implementation was relying on subgroup checks to perform point-on-curve checks as well. The version of gnark-crypto used at the time did not do this check when performing subgroup checks. The result is that it was possible for Besu to give an incorrect result and fall out of consensus when executing one of these precompiles against a specially crafted input point. Additionally, homogenous Besu-only networks can potentially enshrine invalid state which would be incorrect and difficult to process with patched versions of besu which handle these calls correctly. The underlying defect has been patched in besu-native release 1.3.0. The fixed version of Besu is version 25.3.0. As a workaround for versions of Besu with the problem, the native precompile for altbn128 may be disabled in favor of the pure-java implementation. The pure java implementation is significantly slower, but does not have this consensus issue.",

While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher.

An attacker needs to control one of the feeds that the victim is subscribed to, and also must have an account on the FreshRSS instance. Other than that, the iframe payload can be embedded as one of two options. The first payload requires user interaction (the user clicking on the malicious feed entry) with default user configuration, and the second payload fires instantly right after the user adds the feed or logs into the account while the feed entry is still visible. This is because of lazy image loading functionality, which the second payload bypasses. An attacker can gain access to the victim's account by exploiting this vulnerability. If the victim is an admin it would be possible to delete all users (cause damage) or execute arbitrary code on the server by modifying the update URL using fetch() via the XSS.

In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0).

AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked.

The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED.

From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.",

This issue only affects the Pages Router under certain misconfigurations, causing normal endpoints to serve `pageProps` data instead of standard HTML. This issue was patched in versions 15.1.6 and 14.2.24 by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from incoming requests. Applications hosted on Vercel's platform are not affected by this issue, as the platform does not cache responses based solely on `200 OK` status without explicit `cache-control` headers. Those who self-host Next.js deployments and are unable to upgrade immediately can mitigate this vulnerability by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from all incoming requests at the content development network and setting `cache-control: no-store` for all responses under risk. The maintainers of Next.js strongly recommend only caching responses with explicit cache-control headers.",

This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.",

The Solr script service that is accessible in XWiki's scripting API normally requires programming rights to be called. Due to using the wrong API for checking rights, it doesn't take the fact into account that programming rights might have been dropped by calling `$xcontext.dropPermissions()`. If some code relies on this for the safety of executing Velocity code with the wrong author context, this could allow a user with script rights to either cause a high load by indexing documents or to temporarily remove documents from the search index.

It first loads\nthe '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()\nand then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir\nentry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the\nsame data block.\n\nIf the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the\nsanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data\nblock) and leaves \"struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de\" point exactly past the\nmemory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to\next4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer\nwhich results in out-of-bounds mem access.\n\nFix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir\nentries that reach the end of data block.

A simple curl to a HTTP\nbackend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large\npacket sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request)\nwhile others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.\n\nIn fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the\nnode with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire\nfor the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been\n152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes\nwas padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we\nsaw user/payload data from prior processed packets).\n\nWe only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and\nthe backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request\ngot dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even\nthough the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to\nthe MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let\nthe curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the\npadding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).\n\nCommit e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") was too eager\nto also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd->len to rbi->len. It really needs\nto stick to rcd->len which is the actual packet length from the descriptor.\nThe latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and\nit indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp->{data,data_end}\nparts. For e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") the\nrelevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the\nxdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp->frame_sz.

The previous patch has inconsistent logic:\n\n   In commit 2f83e38a095f (\"tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes\n   without CAP_SYS_ADMIN\"), we checked for sel_mode ==\n   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, but overlooked that the lower four bits of\n   this \"mode\" parameter were actually used as an additional way to\n   pass an argument.  So the patch did actually still require\n   CAP_SYS_ADMIN, if any of the mouse button bits are set, but did not\n   require it if none of the mouse buttons bits are set.\n\n   This logic is inconsistent and was not intentional.  We should have\n   the same policies for using TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT independent of the\n   value of the \"hidden\" mouse button argument.\n\n   I sent a separate documentation patch to the man page list with\n   more details on TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT:\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250223091342.35523-2-gnoack3000@gmail.com/\n\n2. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is indeed a potential security risk which can\n   let an attacker simulate \"keyboard\" input to command line\n   applications on the same terminal, like TIOCSTI and some other\n   TIOCLINUX \"selection mode\" IOCTLs.\n\n   By enabling mouse reporting on a terminal and then injecting mouse\n   reports through TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, an attacker can simulate\n   mouse movements on the same terminal, similar to the TIOCSTI\n   keystroke injection attacks that were previously possible with\n   TIOCSTI and other TIOCL_SETSEL selection modes.\n\n   Many programs (including libreadline/bash) are then prone to\n   misinterpret these mouse reports as normal keyboard input because\n   they do not expect input in the X11 mouse protocol form.  The\n   attacker does not have complete control over the escape sequence,\n   but they can at least control the values of two consecutive bytes\n   in the binary mouse reporting escape sequence.\n\n   I went into more detail on that in the discussion at\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221.0a947528d8f3@gnoack.org/\n\n   It is not equally trivial to simulate arbitrary keystrokes as it\n   was with TIOCSTI (commit 83efeeeb3d04 (\"tty: Allow TIOCSTI to be\n   disabled\")), but the general mechanism is there, and together with\n   the small number of existing legit use cases (see below), it would\n   be better to revert back to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for\n   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, as it was already the case before\n   commit 2f83e38a095f (\"tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without\n   CAP_SYS_ADMIN\").\n\n3. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only used by the mouse daemons (GPM or\n   Consolation), and they are the only legit use case:\n\n   To quote console_codes(4):\n\n     The mouse tracking facility is intended to return\n     xterm(1)-compatible mouse status reports.  Because the console\n     driver has no way to know the device or type of the mouse, these\n     reports are returned in the console input stream only when the\n     virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.  These\n     ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application\n     such as the gpm(8) daemon.\n\n   Jared Finder has also confirmed in\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/491f3df9de6593df8e70dbe77614b026@finder.org/\n   that Emacs does not call TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT directly, and it\n   would be difficult to find good reasons for doing that, given that\n   it would interfere with the reports that GPM is sending.\n\n   More information on the interaction between GPM, terminals and th\n---truncated---",

      "cveDis": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/eevdf: Fix se->slice being set to U64_MAX and resulting crash\n\nThere is a code path in dequeue_entities() that can set the slice of a\nsched_entity to U64_MAX, which sometimes results in a crash.\n\nThe offending case is when dequeue_entities() is called to dequeue a\ndelayed group entity, and then the entity's parent's dequeue is delayed.\nIn that case:\n\n1. In the if (entity_is_task(se)) else block at the beginning of\n   dequeue_entities(), slice is set to\n   cfs_rq_min_slice(group_cfs_rq(se)). If the entity was delayed, then\n   it has no queued tasks, so cfs_rq_min_slice() returns U64_MAX.\n2. The first for_each_sched_entity() loop dequeues the entity.\n3. If the entity was its parent's only child, then the next iteration\n   tries to dequeue the parent.\n4. If the parent's dequeue needs to be delayed, then it breaks from the\n   first for_each_sched_entity() loop _without updating slice_.\n5. The second for_each_sched_entity() loop sets the parent's ->slice to\n   the saved slice, which is still U64_MAX.\n\nThis throws off subsequent calculations with potentially catastrophic\nresults. A manifestation we saw in production was:\n\n6. In update_entity_lag(), se->slice is used to calculate limit, which\n   ends up as a huge negative number.\n7. limit is used in se->vlag = clamp(vlag, -limit, limit). Because limit\n   is negative, vlag > limit, so se->vlag is set to the same huge\n   negative number.\n8. In place_entity(), se->vlag is scaled, which overflows and results in\n   another huge (positive or negative) number.\n9. The adjusted lag is subtracted from se->vruntime, which increases or\n   decreases se->vruntime by a huge number.\n10. pick_eevdf() calls entity_eligible()/vruntime_eligible(), which\n    incorrectly returns false because the vruntime is so far from the\n    other vruntimes on the queue, causing the\n    (vruntime - cfs_rq->min_vruntime) * load calulation to overflow.\n11. Nothing appears to be eligible, so pick_eevdf() returns NULL.\n12. pick_next_entity() tries to dereference the return value of\n    pick_eevdf() and crashes.\n\nDumping the cfs_rq states from the core dumps with drgn showed tell-tale\nhuge vruntime ranges and bogus vlag values, and I also traced se->slice\nbeing set to U64_MAX on live systems (which was usually \"benign\" since\nthe rest of the runqueue needed to be in a particular state to crash).\n\nFix it in dequeue_entities() by always setting slice from the first\nnon-empty cfs_rq.",

Meanwhile that child hotplug port tries to acquire\npci_lock_rescan_remove() as well in order to remove its own children.\n\nThe deadlock only occurs if the parent acquires pci_lock_rescan_remove()\nfirst, not if the child happens to acquire it first.\n\nSeveral workarounds to avoid the issue have been proposed and discarded\nover the years, e.g.:\n\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/r/4c882e25194ba8282b78fe963fec8faae7cf23eb.1529173804.git.lukas@wunner.de/\n\nA proper fix is being worked on, but needs more time as it is nontrivial\nand necessarily intrusive.\n\nRecent commit 9d573d19547b (\"PCI: pciehp: Detect device replacement during\nsystem sleep\") provokes more frequent occurrence of the deadlock when\nremoving more than one Thunderbolt device during system sleep.  The commit\nsought to detect device replacement, but also triggered on device removal.\nDifferentiating reliably between replacement and removal is impossible\nbecause pci_get_dsn() returns 0 both if the device was removed, as well as\nif it was replaced with one lacking a Device Serial Number.\n\nAvoid the more frequent occurrence of the deadlock by checking whether the\nhotplug port itself was hot-removed.  If so, there's no sense in checking\nwhether its child device was replaced.\n\nThis works because the ->resume_noirq() callback is invoked in top-down\norder for the entire hierarchy:  A parent hotplug port detecting device\nreplacement (or removal) marks all children as removed using\npci_dev_set_disconnected() and a child hotplug port can then reliably\ndetect being removed.",

Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass\noperations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().\n\nAlthough in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh,\nwe made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address\nfilters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast,\nand setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the\nfact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as\nkernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick\nhack.\n\nIt seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim\n.ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP\nin order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from\nrunning, although we could do that.\n\nAccepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option.\nEspecially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different\nangle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even\nfor VLANs:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/\n\nWhat happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails,\nthen the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.\n\nThis is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an\ninformational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see\nthat bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years'\nexperience, to justify the logic.",

The question is why does the guard in mv88e6xxx_mst_put()\nnot exit early:\n\n\tif (!sid)\n\t\treturn 0;\n\nAnd the answer seems to be simple: the sid comes from vlan.sid which\nsupposedly was previously populated by mv88e6xxx_vtu_get().\nBut some chip->info->ops->vtu_getnext() implementations do not populate\nvlan.sid, for example see mv88e6185_g1_vtu_getnext(). In that case,\nlater in mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() we are using a garbage sid which is\njust residual stack memory.\n\nTesting for sid == 0 covers all cases of a non-bridge VLAN or a bridge\nVLAN mapped to the default MSTI. For some chips, SID 0 is valid and\ninstalled by mv88e6xxx_stu_setup(). A chip which does not support the\nSTU would implicitly only support mapping all VLANs to the default MSTI,\nso although SID 0 is not valid, it would be sufficient, if we were to\nzero-initialize the vlan structure, to fix the bug, due to the\ncoincidence that a test for vlan.sid == 0 already exists and leads to\nthe same (correct) behavior.\n\nAnother option which would be sufficient would be to add a test for\nmv88e6xxx_has_stu() inside mv88e6xxx_mst_put(), symmetric to the one\nwhich already exists in mv88e6xxx_mst_get(). But that placement means\nthe caller will have to dereference vlan.sid, which means it will access\nuninitialized memory, which is not nice even if it ignores it later.\n\nSo we end up making both modifications, in order to not rely just on the\nsid == 0 coincidence, but also to avoid having uninitialized structure\nfields which might get temporarily accessed.",

Ensure that\nchild_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within\ninherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the\ncleanup code.\n\nDetails:\n\nThere's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of\nmultiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not\na single regression.\n\nThe code initially incremented refcount then assigned context\nimmediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early\nvalidity check for child_event was added before the\nrefcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was\nadded, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.\nThe problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial\ncheck passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its\nprecondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after\nits initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any\nsubsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().\n\nTo resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment\ndirectly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the\nparent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on\nevent->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is\nnon-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing\nin child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.\n\n[ mingo: Expanded the changelog from another email by Gabriel Shahrouzi. ]",

      "cveDis": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: adjust subpage bit start based on sectorsize\n\nWhen running machines with 64k page size and a 16k nodesize we started\nseeing tree log corruption in production.  This turned out to be because\nwe were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects\nall metadata writes.\n\nWhen writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty\nrange.  If the range isn't dirty we do\n\n\tbit_start++;\n\nto move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the\nnumber of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k\npagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4\nbits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per\npage.\n\nTo make this easier this is how everything looks\n\n[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address\n[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset\n[               64k page               ] folio\n[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers\n[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap\n\nNow we use all of our addressing based on fs_info->sectorsize_bits, so\nas you can see the above our 16k eb->start turns into radix entry 4.\n\nWhen we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the\nnext eb is 4, to correspond to eb->start 16k.\n\nHowever if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now\nput us offset from our radix tree entries.\n\nIn our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is\nnot dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop\naround and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that\nstart using the following equation\n\n\tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info->sectorsize;\n\nso in the case above, eb->start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start\nas\n\n\t0 + 1 * fs_info->sectorsize = 4096\n\t4096 >> 12 = 1\n\nNow we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.\nWhat's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into\nthe same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the\nradix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.\n\nThe best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,\nbut that's a larger change.  Since this is a fs corruption problem fix\nit simply by always using sectors_per_node to increment the start bit.",

Consulting only the host kernel's host vs. guest masks results in\nrunning the guest with PEBS enabled even when the guest doesn't want to use\nPEBS.  Because KVM uses perf events to proxy the guest virtual PMU, simply\nlooking at exclude_host can't differentiate between events created by host\nuserspace, and events created by KVM on behalf of the guest.\n\nRunning the guest with PEBS unexpectedly enabled typically manifests as\ncrashes due to a near-infinite stream of #PFs.  E.g. if the guest hasn't\nwritten MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, the CPU will hit page faults on address '0' when\ntrying to record PEBS events.\n\nThe issue is most easily reproduced by running `perf kvm top` from before\ncommit 7b100989b4f6 (\"perf evlist: Remove __evlist__add_default\") (after\nwhich, `perf kvm top` effectively stopped using PEBS).\tThe userspace side\nof perf creates a guest-only PEBS event, which intel_guest_get_msrs()\nmisconstrues a guest-*owned* PEBS event.\n\nArguably, this is a userspace bug, as enabling PEBS on guest-only events\nsimply cannot work, and userspace can kill VMs in many other ways (there\nis no danger to the host).  However, even if this is considered to be bad\nuserspace behavior, there's zero downside to perf/KVM restricting PEBS to\nguest-owned events.\n\nNote, commit 854250329c02 (\"KVM: x86/pmu: Disable guest PEBS temporarily\nin two rare situations\") fixed the case where host userspace is profiling\nKVM *and* userspace, but missed the case where userspace is profiling only\nKVM.",

This seems a\ntechnicality introduced by commit fddd91016d16 (\"phylib: fix PAL state\nmachine restart on resume\"). That commit was written before phylink\nexisted, and was intended to avoid crashing with consumer drivers which\ndon't use the PHY state machine - phylink always does, when using a PHY.\nBut phylink itself has historically not been developed with\nsuspend/resume in mind, and apparently not tested too much in that\nscenario, allowing this bug to exist unnoticed for so long.

But\nshould_flush_tlb() has a bug and suppresses the flush.  Fix it by\nwidening the window where should_flush_tlb() sends an IPI.\n\nLong Version:\n\n=== History ===\n\nThere were a few things leading up to this.\n\nFirst, updating mm_cpumask() was observed to be too expensive, so it was\nmade lazier.  But being lazy caused too many unnecessary IPIs to CPUs\ndue to the now-lazy mm_cpumask().  So code was added to cull\nmm_cpumask() periodically[2].  But that culling was a bit too aggressive\nand skipped sending TLB flushes to CPUs that need them.  So here we are\nagain.\n\n=== Problem ===\n\nThe too-aggressive code in should_flush_tlb() strikes in this window:\n\n\t// Turn on IPIs for this CPU/mm combination, but only\n\t// if should_flush_tlb() agrees:\n\tcpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(next));\n\n\tnext_tlb_gen = atomic64_read(&next->context.tlb_gen);\n\tchoose_new_asid(next, next_tlb_gen, &new_asid, &need_flush);\n\tload_new_mm_cr3(need_flush);\n\t// ^ After 'need_flush' is set to false, IPIs *MUST*\n\t// be sent to this CPU and not be ignored.\n\n        this_cpu_write(cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm, next);\n\t// ^ Not until this point does should_flush_tlb()\n\t// become true!\n\nshould_flush_tlb() will suppress TLB flushes between load_new_mm_cr3()\nand writing to 'loaded_mm', which is a window where they should not be\nsuppressed.  Whoops.\n\n=== Solution ===\n\nThankfully, the fuzzy \"just about to write CR3\" window is already marked\nwith loaded_mm==LOADED_MM_SWITCHING.  Simply checking for that state in\nshould_flush_tlb() is sufficient to ensure that the CPU is targeted with\nan IPI.\n\nThis will cause more TLB flush IPIs.  But the window is relatively small\nand I do not expect this to cause any kind of measurable performance\nimpact.\n\nUpdate the comment where LOADED_MM_SWITCHING is written since it grew\nyet another user.\n\nPeter Z also raised a concern that should_flush_tlb() might not observe\n'loaded_mm' and 'is_lazy' in the same order that switch_mm_irqs_off()\nwrites them.  Add a barrier to ensure that they are observed in the\norder they are written.",

It's the\nmountpoint of path->mnt.  The thing is, without sufficient locking\n->mnt_parent may change under us and none of the locks are held\nat that point.  The rules are\n\t* mount_lock stabilizes m->mnt_parent for any mount m.\n\t* namespace_sem stabilizes m->mnt_parent, provided that\nm is mounted.\n\t* if either of the above holds and refcount of m is positive,\nwe are guaranteed the same for refcount of m->mnt_parent.\n\nnamespace_sem nests inside inode_lock(), so do_lock_mount() has\nto take inode_lock() before grabbing namespace_sem.  It does\nrecheck that path->mnt is still mounted in the same place after\ngetting namespace_sem, and it does take care to pin the dentry.\nIt is needed, since otherwise we might end up with racing mount --move\n(or umount) happening while we were getting locks; in that case\ndentry would no longer be a mountpoint and could've been evicted\non memory pressure along with its inode - not something you want\nwhen grabbing lock on that inode.\n\nHowever, pinning a dentry is not enough - the matching mount is\nalso pinned only by the fact that path->mnt is mounted on top it\nand at that point we are not holding any locks whatsoever, so\nthe same kind of races could end up with all references to\nthat mount gone just as we are about to enter inode_lock().\nIf that happens, we are left with filesystem being shut down while\nwe are holding a dentry reference on it; results are not pretty.\n\nWhat we need to do is grab both dentry and mount at the same time;\nthat makes inode_lock() safe *and* avoids the problem with fs getting\nshut down under us.  After taking namespace_sem we verify that\npath->mnt is still mounted (which stabilizes its ->mnt_parent) and\ncheck that it's still mounted at the same place.  From that point\non to the matching namespace_unlock() we are guaranteed that\nmount/dentry pair we'd grabbed are also pinned by being the mountpoint\nof path->mnt, so we can quietly drop both the dentry reference (as\nthe current code does) and mnt one - it's OK to do under namespace_sem,\nsince we are not dropping the final refs.\n\nThat solves the problem on do_lock_mount() side; unlock_mount()\nalso has one, since dentry is guaranteed to stay pinned only until\nthe namespace_unlock().

When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same\nregisters simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the\nRLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This\nmeans that only one thread can access the registers at a time,\npreventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed\ncorrectly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a\nhigh-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to\nacquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in\namdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.\n\nThe call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being\ncalled, which attempts to acquire the mutex.

If not, it logs\n\"ea_get: invalid extended attribute\" and calls print_hex_dump().\n\nHere, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds\nINT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:\n\n\tint size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));\n\nAlthough clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper\nlimit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads\n\"size\" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).\n\nThe \"size\" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called \"len\" in\nprint_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned\ntype), this is then stored inside a variable called\n\"int remaining\", which is then assigned to \"int linelen\" which\nis then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()\nthe for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is\n18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()\non each iteration:\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) {\n\t\tlinelen = min(remaining, rowsize);\n\t\tremaining -= rowsize;\n\n\t\thex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,\n\t\t\t\t   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);\n\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\nThe expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken\nsince len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to\nthe \"ptr+i\" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer\nto the end of the actual bounds of \"ptr\", eventually an out of\nbounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following\nfor loop:\n\n\tfor (j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n\t\t\tif (linebuflen < lx + 2)\n\t\t\t\tgoto overflow2;\n\t\t\tch = ptr[j];\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\nTo fix this we should validate \"EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)\"\nbefore it is utilised.",

What am I trying to do:\n\nThis patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure\nhandling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as\ncompared to 5.10 LTS.\n\n    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space\n    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space\n\n## 2. What is the expected outcome and why\n\n- For copyin case:\n\nKernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or\ncopy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return\n-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler\nchecks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be\nrecovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code\nspecified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.\n\n- For instr case:\n\nIf a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery\nis possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills\nby reading from storage.\n\n\n## 3. What actually happens and why\n\n- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17\n\nCommit 4c132d1d844a (\"x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage\") introduced a new\nextable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the\nextable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from\nEX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS\nhandling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().\n\n- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI\n  and #MCE race\n\nWhen an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the\nCMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA\nsignature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when\nthe data is about to be consumed.\n\n### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]\n\nPrior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that\ndetected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a\nbroadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action\nOptional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because\nit's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that\nbad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE\ninterrupts and finally become an IERR.\n\nHence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub\nfrom SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to\n#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in\nuc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*\nsignature name.\n\n### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in\n    Intel platform [1]\n\nHaving decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,\nthe memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is\nexecuting asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference\nbetween a \"real\" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if\nan error is found in any read.\n\nThus:\n\n1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a\n   speculative read.\n\n2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read\n   request\n\n3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the\n   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.\n\nQuite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory\ncontroller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction\nreading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page\n(marking it as poison).\n\n\n## Why user process is killed for instr case\n\nCommit 046545a661af (\"mm/hwpoison: fix error page recovered but reported\n\"not\n---truncated---",

The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.\n\nNote: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check. Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code.

A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can access Orchestration of the APPs.",

Prior to version 1.90.0, n8n is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) through the attachments view endpoint. n8n workflows can store and serve binary files, which are accessible to authenticated users. However, there is no restriction on the MIME type of uploaded files, and the MIME type could be controlled via a GET parameter. This allows the server to respond with any MIME type, potentially enabling malicious content to be interpreted and executed by the browser. An authenticated attacker with member-level permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type set to text/html, the script executes in the context of the user’s session. This script could send a request to change the user’s email address in their account settings, effectively enabling account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 1.90.0.",

Note that, by default, there is only one authenticator available (Standard XWiki Authenticator). So, if no authenticator extension was installed, it's not really possible to do anything for an attacker. Also, in most cases, if an SSO authenticator is installed and utilized (like OIDC or LDAP for example), the worst an attacker can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password, and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce).

Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable: false` or `defaultIsFilterable: false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable: false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, don't use functions); set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema; and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.",

The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies.

      "cveDis": "MobSF is a mobile application security testing tool used. Typically, MobSF is deployed on centralized internal or cloud-based servers that also host other security tools and web applications. Access to the MobSF web interface is often granted to internal security teams, audit teams, and external vendors.  MobSF provides a feature that allows users to upload ZIP files for static analysis. Upon upload, these ZIP files are automatically extracted and stored within the MobSF directory. However, in versions up to and including 4.3.2, this functionality lacks a check on the total uncompressed size of the ZIP file, making it vulnerable to a ZIP of Death (zip bomb) attack. Due to the absence of safeguards against oversized extractions, an attacker can craft a specially prepared ZIP file that is small in compressed form but expands to a massive size upon extraction. Exploiting this, an attacker can exhaust the server's disk space, leading to a complete denial of service (DoS) not just for MobSF, but also for any other applications or websites hosted on the same server. This vulnerability can lead to complete server disruption in an organization which can affect other internal portals and tools too (which are hosted on the same server). If some organization has created their customized cloud based mobile security tool using MobSF core then an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash their servers. Commit 6987a946485a795f4fd38cebdb4860b368a1995d fixes this issue. As an additional mitigation, it is recommended to implement a safeguard that checks the total uncompressed size of any uploaded ZIP file before extraction. If the estimated uncompressed size exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 100 MB), MobSF should reject the file and notify the user.",

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Attributes extension of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML. The league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces. Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector: All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default; support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes; and manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option. If upgrading is not feasible, please consider disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users and/or filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier.",

These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session. However, prior to versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10, it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed an attacker with access to the application’s URI to retrieve the id and token, enabling them to authenticate on behalf of the user. It's important to note that the use of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and, consequently, access to the ZITADEL API.

The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods on the CPU side.​ The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network. The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface.

A token that consists of 6 digits only presents weak entropy however and when coupled with no token brute force protection, makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of a valid email address to successfully brute force the token within 15 minutes (token expiration time) and take over the account associated with the targeted email address.

Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.  When decrypting and verifying signed+encrypted messages, decrypt and verify the message in two steps, by first calling `openpgp.decrypt` without `verificationKeys`, and then passing the returned signature(s) and a new message containing the decrypted data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.",

This potentially affects any course using custom Python-graded problem blocks. The openedx/configuration repo has had a patch since 2016 in the form of an nginx rule, but this was only intended as a temporary mitigation. As the configuration repo has been deprecated and we have not been able to locate any similar protection in Tutor, it is likely that most deployments have no protection against python_lib.zip being downloaded. The recommended mitigation, implemented in commit 6740e75c0fdc7ba095baf88e9f5e4f3e15cfd8ba, restricts python_lib.zip downloads to just the course team and site staff/superusers.",

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams`, which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size`, which Introduces a server-wide, bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in the Corefile, use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage, and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies.",

Part of the security model of required rights is that a user who doesn't have a right also cannot define that right as required right. That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure that they're not giving a right to a script or object that it didn't have before. A bug in the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check. Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions. As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining programming right could have a high impact. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.10.4 and 17.1.0RC1. No known workarounds are available except for upgrading.",

Prior to version 3.4.20-beta3, an attacker convincing a user to view a file in a commit of their making in the history view can cause information disclosure by means of Git attempting to access a network share. This affects GitHub Desktop users on Windows that view malicious commits in the history view. macOS users are not affected. When viewing a file diff in the history view GitHub Desktop will call `git log` or `git diff` with the object id (SHA) of the commit, the name of the file, and the old name of the file if the file has been renamed. As a security precaution Git will attempt to fully resolve the old and new path via `realpath`, traversing symlinks, to ensure that the resolved paths reside within the repository working directory. This can lead to Git attempting to access a path that resides on a network share (UNC path) and in doing so Windows will attempt to perform NTLM authentication which passes information such as the computer name, the currently signed in (Windows) user name, and an NTLM hash. GitHub Desktop 3.4.20 and later fix this vulnerability. The beta channel includes the fix in 3.4.20-beta3.

This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.",

      "cveDis": "Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.14 and 1.00-alpha are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue when Entra ID group-based access restrictions are configured using group display names instead of object IDs. Starting in version 0.9.0, Himmelblau introduced support for specifying group names in the `pam_allow_groups` configuration option. However, Microsoft Entra ID permits the creation of multiple groups with the same `displayName` via the Microsoft Graph API—even by non-admin users, depending on tenant settings. As a result, a user could create a personal group with the same name as a legitimate access group (e.g., `\"Allow-Linux-Login\"`), add themselves to it, and be granted authentication or `sudo` rights by Himmelblau. Because affected Himmelblau versions compare group names by either `displayName` or by the immutable `objectId`, this allows bypassing access control mechanisms intended to restrict login to members of official, centrally-managed groups. This issue is fixed in Himmelblau version **0.9.15** and later. In these versions, group name matching in `pam_allow_groups` has been deprecated and removed, and only group `objectId`s (GUIDs) may be specified for secure group-based filtering. To mitigate the issue without upgrading, replace all entries in `pam_allow_groups` with the objectId of the target Entra ID group(s) and/or audit your tenant for groups with duplicate display names using the Microsoft Graph API.",

The vulnerability stems from the way the HAXCMS backend handles the location field in the site's outline.

Later the location parameter is interpreted by the CMS to resolve and load the content for a given node.

The conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock setup script is vulnerable due to the unsafe use of the eval function when parsing version information from a custom-formatted meta.yaml file. An attacker controlling meta.yaml can inject malicious code into the version assignment, which is executed during file processing, leading to arbitrary code execution. Exploitation requires an attacker to modify the recipe file by manipulating the RECIPE_DIR variable and introducing a malicious meta.yaml file. While this is more feasible in CI/CD pipelines, it is uncommon in typical environments, reducing overall risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.15.0.",
